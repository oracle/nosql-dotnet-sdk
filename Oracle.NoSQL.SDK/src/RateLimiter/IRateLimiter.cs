    /// Rate limiting is used to provide efficient access to Oracle NoSQL
    /// Database Cloud Service, maximize throughput and protect from resource
    /// starvation.  The SDK provides built-in rate limiting functionality for
    /// data operations on tables such as <see cref="NoSQLClient.GetAsync"/>,
    /// <see cref="NoSQLClient.PutAsync"/>,
    /// <see cref="NoSQLClient.DeleteAsync"/>,
    /// <see cref="M:Oracle.NoSQL.SDK.NoSQLClient.DeleteRangeAsync*"/>,
    /// <see cref="M:Oracle.NoSQL.SDK.NoSQLClient.WriteManyAsync*"/>,
    /// <see cref="NoSQLClient.PrepareAsync"/>,
    /// <see cref="M:Oracle.NoSQL.SDK.NoSQLClient.QueryAsync*"/> and their
    /// variants.  Rate limiting in the driver allows spreading the operations
    /// over time thus maximizing throughput by avoiding costly throttling
    /// exceptions (see <see cref="ReadThrottlingException"/> and
    /// <see cref="WriteThrottlingException"/>) and the associated retry
    /// handling.
    /// </para>
    /// <para>
    /// Each operation listed above does reads and/or writes on a table and
    /// thus consumes certain number of read and write units (see
    /// <see cref="ConsumedCapacity"/>).  Each table in NoSQL Database Cloud
    /// Service defines limits on the maximum number of read and write units
    /// that can be consumed by all clients accessing the table, per 1 second
    /// time.  For provisioned tables (see
    /// <see cref="CapacityMode.Provisioned"/>) these limits are defined in
    /// <see cref="TableLimits"/>, for on-demand tables (see
    /// <see cref="CapacityMode.OnDemand"/>), higher predefined limits are
    /// used. Thus, the total rate of operations on a given table is limited.
    /// If a client tries to perform the operations at faster rate, the
    /// service will respond with a read or write throttling exception, in
    /// which case the client can retry the operation after certain time
    /// (this behavior may be defined by <see cref="NoSQLRetryHandler"/>).
    /// Handling throttling exceptions and their retries is costly both for
    /// the service and the client application since the application has to
    /// wait before an operation can be retried (retrying immediately or not
    /// waiting enough will only result in another throttling exception and
    /// more load on the service).  A much better strategy for a client is to
    /// spread out the operations over time to an extent that the table limits
    /// for a given table are not exceeded and thus avoiding throttling errors
    /// and their retries.  Rate limiting built in to the SDK provides this
    /// functionality.

    /// An instance of <see cref="IRateLimiter"/> is used to enforce one table

    /// and another for write limit.  You have a choice of using a default
    /// implementation of rate limiter provided by the SDK or providing a
    /// custom implementation of <see cref="IRateLimiter"/> interface.
    /// See <see cref="NoSQLRateLimiter"/> for details on default rate limiter
    /// used by the SDK.  To use custom rate limiter implementation, set

    /// in the background to obtain the table limits as soon as any data
    /// operation is issued for that table.  This means that enabling rate
    /// limiting for a table may be delayed until its table limits are

    /// The main operation of rate limiting in the driver is to call
    /// <see cref="ConsumeUnitsAsync"/> to consume a number of (read or write)
    /// units for a given operation.  Depending on rate limiting
    /// implementation, its current state and the number of units to
    /// consume, this call may asynchronously block (sleep) for certain amount
    /// of time (and return <see cref="Task"/> returning this amount of time)
    /// before letting the operation proceed.  This API also needs to
    /// correctly operate in the presence of timeout set by the caller.  Note
    /// that it may be possible to consume certain amount of units without
    /// blocking (e.g. if there has been no or very little recent activity).
    /// In this state the rate limiter is said to be under its limit.
    /// Conversely, even consuming 0 units may block as a result of consuming
    /// units for recent past operations.  In this state the rate limiter is
    /// said to be over its limit.

    /// Rate limiting works best when we know in advance how many units each

    /// with this information returned as part of
    /// <see cref="ConsumedCapacity"/>.  It may be difficult or impossible to
    /// estimate number of units required before the operation completes.  The
    ///approach is taken where <see cref="ConsumeUnitsAsync"/> is called
    /// twice, once before the operation passing 0 units to (possibly) wait
    /// until the rate limiter is under its limit and then after the operation
    /// passing the number of units returned as part of
    /// <see cref="ConsumedCapacity"/> of the result.  This will allow to
    /// delay subsequent operations and stagger subsequent concurrent
    /// operations over time.
    /// </para>
    /// <para>

    /// different machines, rate limiters in one instance will not be aware of
    /// operations performed by other instances and thus will not correctly
    /// rate limit the operations.  If multiple concurrent
    /// <see cref="NoSQLClient"/> instances are required, you can set
    /// <see cref="NoSQLConfig.RateLimiterPercent"/> property of the
    /// initial configuration to allocate only a percentage of each table's
