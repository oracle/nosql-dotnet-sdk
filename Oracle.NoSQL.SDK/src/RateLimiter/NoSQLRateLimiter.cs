    /// state is kept in terms of time instead of tokens. It is assumed
    /// that the units refill at constant rate being equivalent to the set
    /// limit of units per second.  The state is kept in terms of
    /// <c>next</c>, which is the time when the next operation can proceed
    /// without waiting, meaning the limiter is at its limit.  All operations
    /// issued before <c>next</c> will have to wait accordingly.  Based on
    /// the value of <c>next</c> and the current time, the appropriate
    /// wait time may be computed before the wait begins.  If current time is
    /// greater than or equal to <c>next</c>, no wait is needed.

    /// <para>
    /// Note that when <see cref="ConsumeUnitsAsync"/> is called, the entered
    /// units will only affect the wait time of subsequent operations and not
    /// the current operation, which will use the value of <c>next</c> as
    /// it currently is to determine the wait time.  This is done to avoid
    /// needless wait time when the operations come in rarely.
    /// </para>
    /// <para>
    /// Because every time when <see cref="ConsumeUnitsAsync"/> is called with
