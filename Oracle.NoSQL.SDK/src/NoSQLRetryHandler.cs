    /// This is the default retry handler used by the driver, but it can
    /// also be customized via the provided properties.  The general semantics
    /// is as follows:
    /// <list type="bullet">
    /// <item>
    /// <description>
    /// The operations are retried up to the maximum number of times indicated by
    /// <see cref="MaxRetryAttempts"/> property (with the default value of 10).
    /// </description>
    /// </item>
    /// <item>
    /// <description>
    /// The retry delay follows the exponential back-off.  The initial base
    /// delay is given by <see cref="BaseDelay"/> property (with the default
    /// value of 1 second).  The total delay is computed as a sum of the base
    /// delay component which starts with <see cref="BaseDelay"/> and
    /// increases two-fold on each retry and a small random delay between 0
    /// and initial  <see cref="BaseDelay"/>.
    /// </description>
    /// </item>
    /// </list>
    /// However, there are several exceptions:
    /// <list type="bullet">
    /// <item>
    /// <description>
    /// Operations that fail with
    /// <see cref="ControlOperationThrottlingException"/> use much longer base
    /// delay given by <see cref="ControlOperationBaseDelay"/> property.
    /// These are usually table DDL operations that have much more stringent
    /// rate limitations in the cloud and thus should be retried much less
    /// often.  The delay algorithm is still exponential back-off but uses
    /// the base delay of <see cref="ControlOperationBaseDelay"/> (with the
    /// default value of 1 minute).
    /// </description>
    /// </item>
    /// <item>
    /// <description>
    /// Network-related exceptions and
    /// <see cref="SecurityInfoNotReadyException"/> are always retried (up to
    /// the operation timeout) regardless of the number of retries done so
    /// far (thus ignoring <see cref="MaxRetryAttempts"/>).
    /// </description>
    /// </item>
    /// <item>
    /// <description>
    /// For <see cref="SecurityInfoNotReadyException"/> the delay algorithm
    /// starts with constant delays of 1 second up to 10 retries and after
    /// that follows the exponential back-off.
    /// </description>
    /// </item>
    /// <item>
    /// <description>
    /// <see cref="InvalidAuthorizationException"/> will be retried as long as
    /// the exception on the previous retry (if any) was not
    /// <see cref="InvalidAuthorizationException"/>.
    /// <see cref="InvalidAuthorizationException"/> may indicate that the
    /// authentication token is expired in which case the operation should be
    /// retried, which will involve the refresh of the authentication token.
    /// On the other hand, if subsequent retries fail with
    /// <see cref="InvalidAuthorizationException"/>, this most likely
    /// indicates invalid credentials in which case the operation should not
    /// be retried again.
