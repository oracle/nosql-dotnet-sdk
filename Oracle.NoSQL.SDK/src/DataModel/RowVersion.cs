    /// <see cref="RowVersion"/> is an opaque type that represents the version
    /// of a row in the database.  The version is returned by successful
    /// <see cref="NoSQLClient.GetAsync"/> operation and can be used by
    /// <see cref="NoSQLClient.PutIfVersionAsync"/>,
    /// <see cref="NoSQLClient.DeleteIfVersionAsync"/> and
    /// <see cref="M:Oracle.NoSQL.SDK.NoSQLClient.WriteManyAsync*"/> APIs to
    /// conditionally perform those operations to ensure an atomic
    /// read-modify-write cycle.  This is an opaque object from an application
    /// perspective.  Using <see cref="RowVersion"/> in this way adds cost to
    /// operations so it should be done only if necessary.
    /// </remarks>
    /// <example>
    /// Using <see cref="RowVersion"/> for a conditional Put operation.
    /// <code>
    /// var row = new MapValue

    ///     ["id"] = 1000,
